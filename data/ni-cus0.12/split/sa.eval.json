It's a standard metal one-nothing fancy. These refills are way to thick to fit. I used pliers to open up the curler area and to make the refill fit. I rigged it well enough but the refills are way too squishy as in my eye lashes the curler is unable to hold my lashes. A complete waste of time and money. In addition, I ruined my perfectly functioning eye lash curler to try to get the squishy eye lash curler refills to fit. These refills were comparable to using a sponge to curl eyelashes.
