The unit arrived quickly, was well packaged and arrived intact (always a good sign). There are five wall mounts-- three on the top and two on the bottom. I wanted to mount it on the wall, so all I had to do was to remove the top two layers of plastic drawers, as well as the bottom corner drawers, place it when I wanted and mark it; I then used some of the new plastic screw in wall anchors (the 50 pound variety) and it easily mounted to the wall. Some have remarked that they wanted dividers for the drawers, and that they made those. Good idea. My application was that I needed something that I can see the contents at about eye level, so I wanted the fuller-sized drawers. I also like that these are the new plastic that doesn't get brittle and split like my older plastic drawers did. I like the all-plastic construction. It's heavy duty enough to hold metal parts, but being made of plastic it's not as heavy as a metal frame, so you can easily mount it to the wall and still load it up with heavy stuff, or light stuff.

It did it to my fathers kitchen floor and ruined a structural beam that ran through the kitchen and laundry room. Thousands of dollars of damage to hos house!! When this icemaker fills to capacity it will shut off an a red light will come on, and it will wait until you empty it enough to get below the full mark. I accidentally left it overnight, and the icecubes were in fine shape, only a couple had partially melted (the water returns into the system to make more ice). So even though it is not meant to have the ice just sitting in it \"like a freezer\", I was impressed that they kept in as good of shape as they had! Love my icemaker and highly reccomend it!! For any reason, not only for medical. Now, if I was going to have a big party, I suggest starting to save your ice a couple days, or more, ahead so you have enough! But, this ice maker WILL pay for itself, because ice at the store is expensive!", "task_name": "task1312_amazonreview_polarity_classification"}

Your task is to divide them into two classes: negative or positive, depending on the content of the review.\n\nGreat top. I have order 3 different tops like this with the sports bra attached. This one is the best to me. It is very soft and comfortable. I ordered the L because in the photos it looks snug on the hips which is not my preference but im a 36B. It worked out. The bra isnt really tight, but not loose at all. The medium i think would have been fine, but a tighter bra fit, but then the whole shirt may have been tight. Even in the Large, the fit on me is not loose. Im 150, 5'4\", athletic build. Its a nice comfortable fit. I feel like i will be able to run in this one and not have it ride up on me which is what happens when the tops are too snug on the hips. I will definitely buy more of this one. I got the purple. It is as pictured. Hope this helps :-)", "task_name": "task1312_amazonreview_polarity_classification"}
